# A transfer is an amount which is debited from one Account (the source account) and credited
# to another Account (the target account). Therefore, a transfer is made of two basic operations:
# a credit and a debit. The creation of a transfer implies the creation of a Debit on the source
# account, and a Credit on the target account.
#
# Of course, the source Account must be distinct from the target Account.
#
# A Customer is only able to create transfers on his own accounts. That means, he cannot
# transfer money from accounts that do not belong to him. In this case, the global balance
# of all the customer accounts remains unchanged.
#
# However, a Manager has more privileges. He can create transfers on cross-cutomer accounts.
#
# Although a transfer may be seen like an operation, technically it is not. It is a composition
# of two separate operations: a Debit and a Credit.
