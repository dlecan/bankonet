# A manager of Bankonet. To access the Bankonet Administration application, a manager will be requested
# to sign in by providing his username and password. However, managers are not allowed to access 
# Bankonet standard application, as it is reserved to Bankonet customers.

# Every manager is able to create, edit or delete any customers profiles and accounts descriptions. He is
# also allowed to transfer money between accounts from different customers, or create any operation
# such as debitting or crediting a customer account.
#
# A manager cannot create or access other managers profiles.
