# An base class to represent any operation that can occurs on every account,
# such as a debit or a credit.
# 
# An operation is bound to only one account. Each operation has an amount, which is
# a decimal, with a scale of 2.
#
# Every subclass should implement the method +modify_account_balance+ to alter the
# balance of the bound account, according to the amount of the operation.
